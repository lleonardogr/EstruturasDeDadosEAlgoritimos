TASK 0:
    Since the Task0 always take the first line of the texts, the variation of the file doesn't 
    impact the complexity of the script, so:
    - WorstCase Cenario = 14
    - Big O = O(14)


TASK 1:
    Since we have just one loop, each line on the files will make the check on the function so:
    - WorstCase Cenario = 5213*4 + 9073*4
    - Big O = O(4n)

TASK 2:
    Since we have just one loop but we're checking our list two times, 
    each line on the files will make the check on the function so:
    - WorstCase Cenario = 5213^3 + 9073^3
    - Big O = O(n^3)

TASK 3:
    Part A:
        Since we have just one loop but we're checking our list one time, 
        each line on the files will make the check on the function so:
        - WorstCase Cenario = 5213^2 + 9073^2
        - Big O = O(n^2)
    Part B:
         Since we have just one loop, each line on the files will make the check on the function so:
        - WorstCase Cenario = 5213*3 + 9073*3
        - Big O = O(3n)

TASK 4:
    Since we have just one loop but we're checking our list two times, 
    each line on the files will make the check on the function so:
    - WorstCase Cenario = 5213^3 + 9073^3
    - Big O = O(n^3)
